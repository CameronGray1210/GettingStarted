# School of Software Design and Data Science \(SDDS\)

## Hardware
What you need to be successful in the school of SDDS.

You will require:

### Windows Hardware

* A computer running Windows 10 \(or 11\). Recommended minimum specifications are:
    * RAM: 16GB
    * Processor: Quad-core processor with a minimum 2.4 GHz clock speed
    * Storage: 256GB Solid State Drive (SSD)
    * Peripherals: Keyboard, mouse/trackpad, webcam, microphone
    * DELL: Seneca has preferential pricing with DELL \(the 'regular user model' is sufficient for most of your coursework.\)

:::info Note
* **ARM-based** Windows machines are not recommended as the College VPN does not support ARM.
* Windows 10 is no longer available from Seneca. You are responsible for obtaining your own licensed operating system.
:::

### Mac OSX Hardware
An Intel based Mac or MacBook is acceptable as it will support side-loading of Windows for some applications by implementing virtual machines. The specifications below take this into consideration.

* Recommended minimum specifications are:
    * RAM: 16GB
    * Processor: Quad-core processor \(any base quad core processors in MacBook Air, Pro 13/16" are acceptable\)
    * 512GB storage \(preferably an SSD\)
    * Peripherals: Keyboard, mouse/trackpad, webcam, microphone

:::info Note
* **You will have to run Windows on your Mac** in order to run the software required for your courses. Windows can be loaded a few different ways:
    * **Bootcamp** (Intel processor only)
    * **VMWare** (free) allows  you to run Windows virtually
    * **Parallels** (50% off for students)
        * Parallels and Windows are available here for SDDS students: **https://senecacollege.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx** 
        * A copy of Windows Education is available free for SDDS students.
        * Apple offers bonus education discounts on the Air and 13‚Äù Pro about 6 weeks before and after the start of fall semester

### Internet
A high-speed internet connection is needed for online/hybrid courses, and requires a **minimum bandwidth of 25mb/sec down, and 2mb/sec up**, faster than that is better. The Canadian government has mandated that 50 down and 10 up should be the minimum required to call a connection high-speed.
